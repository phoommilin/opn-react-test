# Opn React Test AssignmentðŸ¦„

![Build and Test](https://github.com/datawowio/nextjs-template/actions/workflows/build_and_test.yml/badge.svg)

Welcome to the Opn React Test repository! ðŸš€ This project is a showcase of my skills and creativity in building modern web applications with React. Itâ€™s designed to meet the challenge set by Opn, demonstrating not only my technical prowess but also my passion for crafting clean, efficient, and user-friendly interfaces.

## Available Commands ðŸ¤–

This project comes with a set of predefined commands that streamline common development tasks. Each command is crafted to help you efficiently manage and build your React application. Hereâ€™s what you can do with them:

| Command                | Description                                                     |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| `yarn server`           | Starts a JSON server with db.json on port 3001 for mock data.                          |
| `yarn client` | Runs the application in development mode using Webpack.                            |
| `yarn test`          | Runs the test suite with Jest. |

In case you are having problem running `yarn client`, try to run this command on terminal `export NODE_OPTIONS=--openssl-legacy-provider`. This will tells Node.js to use the legacy OpenSSL provider, which is related to cryptographic functionality. If you're using Node.js v17 or newer and encounter issues related to OpenSSL, this command can help keep your project running without having to immediately upgrade or modify cryptographic dependencies.
